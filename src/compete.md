The main contest-series in which we participate is [ICPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Collegiate_Programming_Contest), which stands for International Collegiate Programming Contest. In it, student teams of 3 travel to different competitions, working to solve algorithmic problems under time pressure.
